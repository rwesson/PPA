Close a branch:

tag the tip of the branch by archiving it, and then delete the branch.

git tag archive/<branchname> <branchname>
git branch -d <branchname>
git checkout master

The branch will be deleted, and can be retrieved later by checking out the tag, and recreating the branch.

git checkout archive/<branchname>
git checkout -b new_branch_name

Or more simply :

git checkout -b new_branch_name archive/<branchname>
