Description: Dust Affected Models Of Characteristic Line Emission in Supernovae
 damocles models the effects of dust on the line profiles of core-collapse
 supernovae in order to determine newly formed dust masses.  The code can treat
 dust composed of multiple species and grain sizes, with variable ejecta
 density and velocity distributions.  Both clumped and smooth geometries may be
 modelled.
