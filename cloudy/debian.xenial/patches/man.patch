+.SH NAME
+cloudy \- photoionization simulations for the discriminating astrophysicist since 1978
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+cloudy
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+\fBcloudy\fR is a spectral synthesis code designed to simulate conditions in interstellar matter under a broad range of conditions.  Full documentation is in /usr/share/doc/cloudy and on the cloudy web page at http://www.nublado.org
+.SH OPTIONS
+Supported flags are:
+.PP
+\fB\-p\fR example
+.IP
+Cloudy reads the input from the file example.in
+and writes the output to the file example.out.
+Additionally, all file names in SAVE commands are
+prepended with the string "example", e.g. the
+output of SAVE DR ".dr" will be in example.dr.
+.PP
+\fB\-r\fR example
+.IP
+This does the same as the \fB\-p\fR switch, except that
+the names used in SAVE commands are not altered.
+.PP
+\fB\-g\fR example
+.IP
+This switch is used internally in MPI grid runs.
+Normal users should not use this switch.
+.PP
+\fB\-a\fR
+.IP
+This switch is used in debugging. It causes the
+code to crash rather than exit gracefully after
+a failed assert. This flag is deprecated.
+.PP
+\fB\-h\fR
