+.SH NAME
+\fBbhmie\fR
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+\fBbhmie\fR [parameter_file] ...
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.PP
+This is a wrapper program for the dust scattering property calculation
+code by C.F.  Bohren and D.  Huffman (improved by B.  Draine).
+.SH Running
+.PP
+To use, type:
+.IP
+.nf
+\f[C]
+bhmie\ parameter_file
+\f[]
+.fi
+.PP
+Examples are included inside the examples/ directory.
+.SH Parameters
+.PP
+The parameter file contains, in the following order:
+.IP \[bu] 2
+the prefix for the output files
+.IP \[bu] 2
+the file format, which can be:
+.RS 2
+.IP \[bu] 2
+1 = single file with wavelength, extinction and scattering
+cross\-sections, opacity to extinction, the average cos(theta), and the
+maximum linear polarization.
+.IP \[bu] 2
+2 = separate files for the wavelength (.wav), scattering angles (.mu),
+albedo (.alb), opacity to extinction (.chi), (.g), and the scattering
+matrix elements (.f11, .f12, .f33, .f34)
+.IP \[bu] 2
+3 = one file per wavelength, contains the scattering matrix elements
+.RE
+.IP \[bu] 2
+the minimum grain size to use for the calculations (in microns)
+.IP \[bu] 2
+the maximum grain size to use for the calculations (in microns)
+.IP \[bu] 2
+the number of grain sizes to use for the calculations
+.IP \[bu] 2
+the number of main scattering angles between 0 and 90 degrees
+.IP \[bu] 2
+the number of extra scattering angles close to theta=0 to resolve strong
+peaks
+.IP \[bu] 2
+the number of chemical components
+.IP \[bu] 2
+the gas\-to\-dust ratio to assume for the opacity (set this to zero if
+you don\[aq]t care about gas)
+.IP \[bu] 2
+the minimum, maximum, and number of wavelengths (microns)
+.PP
+After these parameters should be the following parameters, repeated for
+each component:
+.IP \[bu] 2
+a blank line (or separator)
+.IP \[bu] 2
+the fraction of the mass in the component
+.IP \[bu] 2
+the density of the grains (in g/cm^3)
+.IP \[bu] 2
+the file containing the refractive indices
+.IP \[bu] 2
+the type of dust size distribution
+.IP \[bu] 2
+the parameters of the dust size distribution
+.PP
+There are three types of size distributions supported:
+.IP \[bu] 2
+\[aq]power\[aq] \- a power\-law distribution:
+.RS 2
+.IP
+.nf
+\f[C]
+n(a)\ ~\ a^apower
+\f[]
+.fi
+.RE
+.PP
+The parameters to specify are:
+.IP
+.nf
+\f[C]
+\ \ \ \ amin\ amax\ apower
+\f[]
+.fi
+.PP
+where amin and amax are the minimum and maximum size for the
+distribution, and apower is the power of the size distribution.
+.IP \[bu] 2
+\[aq]ped\[aq] \- a power\-law distribution with exponential dropoff:
+.RS 2
+.IP
+.nf
+\f[C]
+n(a)\ ~\ a^apower\ *\ exp(a/aturn)
+\f[]
+.fi
+.RE
+.PP
+The parameters to specify are:
+.IP
+.nf
+\f[C]
+\ \ \ \ amin\ aturn\ apower
+\f[]
+.fi
+.PP
+where amin and aturn are the minimum and turn\-off size for the
+distribution, and apower is the power of the size distribution.
+.IP \[bu] 2
+\[aq]table\[aq] \- a table containing the relative number of grains as a
+function of size.
+This should be given as a two column space\-delimited ASCII table where
+the first column is the grain size in microns, and the second column is
+the relative number of grains (the distribution is normalized by the
+code)
+.SH Notes
+.PP
+At this time, all components for a given computation should contain the
+same number of wavelengths, and the values should be given at the same
+wavelengths.
+.SH BUGS
+No known bugs.
